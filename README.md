# MEDIO ARTIFICIAL APP

## INTRODUCTION
This project arises to provide a solution to the early death of the hills due to bad processes, 
by the use of the same tools for all the hills and the same soil of sick plants that caused the death or cause 
the growth of the other hills to stop. Due to the poor care of the hills, contaminated crops are mostly generated 
that reduce their quality and in some cases these crops must be discarded in their entirety because the diseases 
of the land cannot be treated in time.
